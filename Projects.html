                    <p class="project-title">Website</p>
                    <p>I decided to make this website as I wanted the opportunity to learn HTML and CSS. These valuable skills are not taught as a part of my marketing degree. I believe that they are, however, essential for new entrants into the digital marketing workplace. I know that by the completion of this website, I will be confident and comfortable using these languages in the workplace. My next step to improve my current website will be to optimise the website for both mobile and tablet devices over the next university break.

                    <p>I was inspired to make an Instagram account for sharing Spanish tips after completing a course on Instagram analytics. Although the program was insightful, I found that without actually posting, viewing my analytics and testing out different theories myself, I would not be able to fully grasp each metric. I originally created this account in January 2020 and kept it running for about two months before deleting it as I found my schedule did not allow me to post at the same time each day. I have now restarted the account in December 2020 as an update to the Facebook Business Suite app allows for scheduling Instagram posts meaning I can maintain a consistent post schedule. During this trial, I will also be pairing my Instagram account with a Facebook Page to see what insights I can gain from the platform.</p>

                    <p>MKTG1501 is UQ's Introduction to Marketing course which all Business and Commerce students take in their first year. I believe that this course had a considerable impact on my interest in the marketing field, and inspired me to put a lot of effort into the project. We were tasked with completing a summary of the lecture content each week, attaching and explaining our work completed in tutorials and finally applying the marketing theory of the week to our life. This project was substantial, however, one of my favourite projects to date. I produly scored 90% on this assignment.</p>

                    <p>FINM1416 is an introductory financial management course for business students at UQ. The course aims to teach knowledge on investing, financial ratios and risk to non-finance focused students. The project in this course was to analyse Tesla and Toyota's position in the market, work through a number of accounting documents and finally, find a loan and finance the purchase of the car. I believe that the assessment taught me to think outside of the box when it came to making purchase decisions as challenges such as the likely survival of the business were considered. This assignment earned me a grade of 92%.</p>

                    <p>IBUS2302 is a course heavily focused on Globalisation. For this course, we were tasked with picking a global trend and discuss the opportunities and threats it presented to Multi-National Enterprises. This assignment was especially interesting to me as I had never been tasked with looking at a trend as widely relevant as in this project. I found this project very insightful and hope that my Intl. Business studies will continue to provide this level of value to me. I scored 94% on this assignment.</p>

                    <p>This project involved choosing a business, completing research on the business and determingng the customer based brand equity of the business based on the CBBE Pyramid. This assignment was particularly interesting as it introduced the concept of brand equity to me. I was graded 85%.</p>

                <p>For this assignment a local business, Fields Brewing Co. approached us and asked for a marketing strategy plan. Internal and external factors had to be considered to ensure that the final plan met the needs of the business and its' consumers. I enjoyed this task as it involved creating a plan from start to finish and allowed for full autonomy over the direction of the business.</p>
